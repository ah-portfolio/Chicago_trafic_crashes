# Chicago_trafic_crashes

## Context :

This project aims to find a link between trafic crashes and weather in the city of Chicago.

### Data Sources :

- CSV file from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/traffic-crashes-crashes

    
- CSV file from https://meteostat.net/fr/

### Tool :

Here Azure Databricks was used to run the notebook on Apache Spark. 

PySpark (Python) was used for processing, and a little bit of pandas combined with matplotlib to plot the data.

### Amelioration :

- Automation expected : create Workflow with task associated to the notebook to automate data extraction and processing
- Save result in database and use more appropriate visualisation tool.
